<h1>Hi, Everyone!</h1>

<h4>Thank you for visiting my Github page!</h4>


<p>If you've come to check out things that I've done, I must apologize because there's not much to check out currently. Most of my Github work is locked in an Enterprise Github account since I focus a lot of my time completing projects for work. However, I plan to bring more fun to my personal page soon! :tada::tada:. Here is my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucas-newkirk/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>; feel free to connect!</p>

<h4>A Little About Me</h4>
<p>
I am currently a Data Scientist at GE Healthcare, where I've been for 5+ years in various analytical roles. I have a Master's degree in Data Science from the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse. I use both R and Python but I prefer Python's robust data science toolsets (pandas, numpy, sklearn, etc). I have experience in the following areas:
  
- [x] Data engineering tasks, such as:
  <ul>
  <li>Writing SQL code to pull data, create tables, & created stored procedures/views</li>
  <li>Creating data prep & ETL pipelines in Python</li>
  <li>Scheduling tasks to automate data flows</li>
  </ul>
  
- [x] NLP, mainly with nltk and spacy
- [x] Building models in Scikit-Learn:
  <ul>
  <li>Linear/Logistic Regression</li>
  <li>SVMs (both classification & regression)</li>
  <li>Tree learners (including ensemble methods like bagging & boosting [xgboost])</li>
  <li>Basic neural networks  :exclamation:<b>area of interest</b>:exclamation:</li>
  </ul>
  
- [x] Apache tools:
  <ul>
  <li>Hive  :honeybee:</li>
  <li>Pig  :pig2:</li>
  <li>Spark with Scala backend  :sparkles:</li>
  </ul>
  
- [x] Cloud Platforms - I've done work on all major platforms (Google, AWS, and Azure)

- [x] Creating modern data visualizations with:
  <ul>
  <li>Spotfire</li>
  <li>Power BI</li>
  <li>Tableau</li>
  <li>Python <i>(Ploty & Dash, Altair, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh)</i></li>
  </ul>
  
</p>

<h4>Goals  :dart:</h4>
<p>I'm working to learn the more advanced machine learning frameworks for deep learning: Tensorflow and Pytorch. I'm studying and practicing the syntax for both and will be uploading what I learn here, along with other things I pick up along the way.</p>
